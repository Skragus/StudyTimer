# StudyTimer
timer that gives you a break at random between a minimum input and a maximum imput

This is my first ever coding project without a tutorial. What I learned from this project is the 
basics of how the HTML structure is and how to style it with CSS with a focus on flexbox because
of it being so prevalent in todays envioronment, I also learned some basic JavaScript concepts 
such as DOM manipulation, the timer logic and getting inputs from the user. Overall this little
app provided me with some nice hands on experience in intergrating HTML, CSS and JS.
